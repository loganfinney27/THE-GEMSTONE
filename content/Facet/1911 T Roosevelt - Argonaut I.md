From 7:45 to 8:45 breakfast will be served in Ridenbaugh Hall to a party composed of the Ex-president with the university faculty, several prominent citizens and governmental officials and the president and secretaries of the various classes of the university.

A stand will be erected directly in front of the administration building from sacks of north Idaho's famous grains, from which the great American statesman will speak. He will be escorted to this stand by the cadets, who will act as guards and keep the space around the platform open. Mr. Roosevelt will be presented by Governor Hawley, who will come to Moscow for the occasion.
The special train which will carry the Ex-president and the escorting party back to Spokane will leave over the electric line at 10:30 a.m.
The students are urged to come out with the stars and stripes and the university colors.
