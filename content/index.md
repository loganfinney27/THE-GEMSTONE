[[Idaho]] is a unique place. It's many distant landscapes inhabited by many complex people.

Just like a gemstone, the Gem State is a glimmering jewel that reflects and refracts what passes through it. 

>*If the press is not free; if speech is not independent and untrammeled; if the mind is shackled or made impotent through fear*, it makes no difference under what form of government you live, you are a subject and not a citizen.
>â€” **U.S. Sen. [[William Borah|William E. Borah]]**, 1917
