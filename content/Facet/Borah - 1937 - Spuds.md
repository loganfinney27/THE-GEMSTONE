"Idaho spuds presented to vice president." A box of [[Idaho]]'s choicest potatoes were presented today to Vice President John N. Garnger by Senators [[William Borah|William E. Borah]], (left) and James P. Pope, both from the famous potato-growing state. The presentation was the signal for challenge issued by the Maine Congressional Delegation to the Idaho Solons for a potato eating contest which will be staged in the House Restaurant tomorrow to test the relative merits of the spuds from the two states. *Harris & Ewing*. Washington, D.C., Dec. 6, 1937
