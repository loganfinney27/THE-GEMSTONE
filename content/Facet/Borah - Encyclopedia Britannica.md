# William Borah

**[[William Borah|William E. Borah]]** (born June 29, 1865, Fairfield, Ill., U.S.—died Jan. 19, 1940, Washington, D.C.) was a Republican U.S. senator from Idaho for 33 years, best known for his major role at the end of World War I (1918) in preventing the United States from joining the League of Nations and the World Court.

Borah practiced law in Boise, Idaho, and in 1892 became chairman of the Republican State Central Committee. He first won election to the U.S. Senate in 1906 and was returned to office five times by large majorities, making his tenure one of the longest in U.S. history. Borah’s distrust of government centralization limited his commitment to social reform, but he did sponsor bills establishing the Department of Labor as well as the federal Children’s Bureau. He also strongly supported the federal income tax and fought the trusts.

Isolationism dominated Borah’s attitudes toward foreign policy. He did, however, sponsor a congressional resolution (1921) calling for [[Borah - 1921 - Necessity for Naval Disarmament|an international naval disarmament conference]] in Washington, D.C., resulting in the Naval Armament Limitation Treaty concluded Feb. 6, 1922. Assuming the chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 1924, he wielded enormous power in this area for the next 16 years.

Borah did not object to international compacts so long as the enforcement mechanism was limited to moral sanctions; thus he lent his support to the Kellogg–Briand Pact (Paris, 1928)—an ineffective multilateral agreement theoretically outlawing war as an instrument of national policy. He consistently upheld diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union and also helped establish the Good Neighbor policy toward Latin America by advocating a fair deal for Mexico during the controversy over foreign-held oil properties (1926–28).

During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Borah supported many New Deal measures designed to relieve internal economic conditions. As European tensions mounted, however, he held fast to his isolationist stance by resisting all attempts to involve the U.S. on the side of the Allies.
