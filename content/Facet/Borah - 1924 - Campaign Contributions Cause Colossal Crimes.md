![[Campaign Contributions Cause Colossal Crimes.jpg]]

Campaign contributions and expenditures have historically led to controversy. This cartoon references a speech given by [[William Borah]], a maverick Republican Senator from Idaho, on the Senate’s investigations of corruption in the government and in campaign contributions in particular. Both the Republican elephant and the Democratic donkey are perplexed by Borah’s statements; they ask each other “Do YOU get it?” suggesting that neither of them wants to give up their lucrative campaign fundraising efforts.
