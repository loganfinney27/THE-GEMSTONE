*Cartoon shows the figure of **Peace** as a pretty woman and angel, standing in the aisle of a train or bus, while **Senators [[William Borah|Borah]]**, **Lodge**, and **Johnson** occupy the seats. The cartoon refers to the successful efforts of the Republican isolationists after World War I to block Senate ratification of the Treaty of Versailles establishing the League of Nations. The cartoonist suggests that the failure of the United States to join the League is a blow to the prospects for peace.*
